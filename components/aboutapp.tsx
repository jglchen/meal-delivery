            This is a semi-commercial meal-delivery app for demonstrations. Everybody can sign up as a regular consumer in this app.
            If regular consumers want to list their restaurants in the app for delivery, any user can express their intent in the app.
            The app administrator has the authority to approve the application. If the application is approved, the applicant will become a restaurant owner.
            Restaurant owners can play dual roles as restaurant owners and as regular consumers. Restaurant owners can place orders as regular users to any restaurant except for the one they manage.
